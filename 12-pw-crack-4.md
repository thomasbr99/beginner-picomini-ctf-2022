1. Open "level4.py" in your terminal. Do you notice anything _different_? We are now dealing with more passwords that we can manually handle. I don't know about you but I don't want to sit here and type out every single password. Why not let the computer do it for us?
2. Try to edit the the program "level4.py" in your favourite terminal editor. Your aim is to figure out a way to go through the list of possible passwords.
